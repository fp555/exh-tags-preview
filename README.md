# E(x)-Hentai Tags Preview
This is an unofficial userscript for e-hentai/exhentai **(WARNING: NSFW)** that displays related tags when you hover over a gallery link.

## Install
If your browser does not natively support userscripts, install something like [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/) or [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/), then go grab the [latest userscript release](https://github.com/fp555/exh-tags-preview/releases/latest/download/script.user.js)

## Troubleshooting
### I found a bug! / It doesn't work!
- Stop using weird browsers that don't respect/implement basic web standards;
  - While it is possible to use userscripts with Internet Explorer, I expect it (including any past or future release) not to work properly. I don't care about IE compatibility, and neither should you.
- Are you using Greasemonkey v4.0 and above? Try using Tampermonkey or Violentmonkey;
- [Open an issue](https://github.com/fp555/exh-tags-preview/issues/new) and convince me it's my fault.

### Hey I'd like you to add...
- [Open an issue](https://github.com/fp555/exh-tags-preview/issues/new) and convince me to do it. Even better, [create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).

### Is this spyware?
- I couldn't care less about your sick fetishes: I already have mine, and I can guarantee they're objectively better than yours :sunglasses:. Your questionable browsing history will remain between you and the NSA. Just [check the code yourself](https://github.com/fp555/exh-tags-preview/blob/master/script.user.js): this script is so trivial I didn't even bother including jQuery.

### How do I get past the panda?
