# E(x)hentai Tags Preview
This is an unofficial userscript for e-hentai/exhentai **(WARNING: NSFW websites)** that displays related tags when you hover over a gallery link. Both list and thumbnails view are supported.

No unrelated features, no jQuery, no reporting your sick fetishes to the FBI. For now.

## Install
If your browser does not natively support userscripts, install something like [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/), [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/) or [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/), then **[click here to install the script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fp555/exh-tags-preview/master/script.user.js)**

## Troubleshooting
### I found a bug! / It doesn't work!
- Stop using weird browsers that don't respect/implement basic web standards (**including Internet Explorer**, see note below);
- Make sure your browser and userscript manager are updated;
- [Open an issue](https://github.com/fp555/exh-tags-preview/issues/new) and convince me it's my fault.

#### IE note
You CAN run this userscript on Internet Explorer, but I expect it (including any past or future release) not to work properly. IE compatibility is not going to be a concern, but *patches welcome* (see next point).

### Hey I'd like you to add...
- [Open an issue](https://github.com/fp555/exh-tags-preview/issues/new) and convince me to do it. Even better, [create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).

### When I go on ExHentai I see an image of a sad panda?!?!
