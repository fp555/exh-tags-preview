# E(x)-Hentai Tags Preview :panda_face::label::mag:
This is an unofficial userscript for e-hentai/exhentai (**NSFW sites** so no links) that displays related tags when you hover over a gallery link. If you can't be bothered opening galleries every time to see all tags and you don't want to use the native *Extended* layout, this is the script for you.

## Install
If your browser does not natively support userscripts, install something like [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/) or [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/), then go grab the [latest userscript release](https://github.com/fp555/exh-tags-preview/releases/latest).

## Configuration
Starting with v1.6.0 the script behavior can be customized by editing the stored values from your userscripts manager:
- **Tampermonkey**: open the Dashboard and click at the script's name, then select the *Storage* tab;
- **Violentmonkey**: open the Dashboard and click the Edit button under the script's name, then select the *Values* tab;
- *anything else*: RTFM.

Run the script once to let it setup its storage. [Check your release notes](https://github.com/fp555/exh-tags-preview/releases) for details on what can be customized.

## Troubleshooting
### I found a bug! / It doesn't work!
- Stop using weird browsers that don't respect/implement basic web standards;
  - While I hear it's possible to use userscripts in Internet Explorer, I expect mine not to work properly. I don't care about IE compatibility, and neither should you.
- Are you using Greasemonkey v4.0+ ? Try using Tampermonkey or Violentmonkey, anything else is untested and you're on your own;
- This script uses emojis as icons: [make sure](http://caniemoji.com/) your browser/OS combination can display them properly;
- [Open an issue](https://github.com/fp555/exh-tags-preview/issues/new) and convince me it's my fault.

### Hey I'd like you to add...
- [Open an issue](https://github.com/fp555/exh-tags-preview/issues/new) and convince me to do it. Even better, [create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).

### Is this spyware?
- I couldn't care less about your sick fetishes: I already have mine, and I can guarantee they're objectively better than yours :sunglasses:. Your questionable browsing history will remain between you and the NSA. Just [check the code yourself](https://github.com/fp555/exh-tags-preview/blob/master/src/script.js): this script is so trivial I didn't even bother including jQuery.

### How do I get past the panda?
