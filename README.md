# E(x)-Hentai Tags Preview :panda_face::label::mag:
This is an unofficial userscript for e-hentai/exhentai (**NSFW sites** so no links) that displays related tags when you hover over a gallery link. If you can't be bothered opening galleries every time to see all tags and you don't want to use the native *Extended* layout, this is the script for you. This strives to be the smallest and most straightforward script that could possibly do a decent enough job.

## Install
If your browser does not natively support userscripts, install something like [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/) or [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/), then go grab the [latest userscript release](https://github.com/fp555/exh-tags-preview/releases/latest/download/script.user.js).

## Configuration
The script will autoconfigure the default settings on first run. Starting with v1.8.0 there is an options button at the bottom right corner of the webpage. [Check your release notes](https://github.com/fp555/exh-tags-preview/releases) for more details on available settings.

## Troubleshooting
### I found a bug! / It doesn't work!
Before [opening an issue](https://github.com/fp555/exh-tags-preview/issues/new) please:
1) Stop using weird and outdated browsers that don't support basic W3C standards or modern CSS/JS features;
2) Make sure your userscript manager is updated to the latest available version;
3) Make sure you are using the latest release of the userscript;
4) This script uses emojis: [make sure](http://caniemoji.com/) your browser/OS combination can display them properly.

### Known issues/limitations
- The popup will be empty if a gallery has no tags at all. Please be a useful member of the community and add some yourself;
- Empty popups for galleries that trigger the "offensive content" warning if you have it enabled. Make sure you **clearly** understand the risks before disabling it;
- Empty popups for inaccessible (permanently deleted, copyright claimed, banned in your country...) galleries.

### Hey why this doesn't have `$feature`?
[Open an issue](https://github.com/fp555/exh-tags-preview/issues/new) and convince me to work on it. Even better: [create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).

### Is this spyware? (Privacy policy)
I couldn't care less about your disgusting fetishes: I already have mine, and I can guarantee they're objectively better than yours :smirk:. Your questionable browsing history shall remain between you and your assigned glow-in-the-dark agent from your domestic brand of alphabet agencies. This userscript was originally made for personal use and convenience, and the idea of collecting user data has never crossed my mind. This userscript has nothing up his sleeve, mainly because it's so small and simple it doesn't even *have* sleeves.
