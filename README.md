## NOTICE:
**this has been partially obsoleted by the Mar 19, 2019 update:** native *Compact* or *Extended* views can be now used to display tags under gallery titles, with support for Tag Filtering.

# E(x)hentai Tags Preview
This is an unofficial userscript for e-hentai/exhentai **(WARNING: NSFW websites)** that displays related tags when you hover over a gallery link. Both list and thumbnails view are supported.

No unrelated features, no jQuery, no reporting your sick fetishes to the NSA. For now.

## Install
If your browser does not natively support userscripts, install something like [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) (**v3.x only**), [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/) or [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/), then **[click here to install the script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fp555/exh-tags-preview/legacy/script.user.js)**

## Troubleshooting
### I found a bug! / It doesn't work!
- Stop using weird browsers that don't respect/implement basic web standards;
  - While it is possible to use this userscript with Internet Explorer, I expect it (including any past or future release) not to work properly. IE compatibility is not going to be a concern for me (I couldn't do tests even if it were), but *patches welcome*;
- Are you using Greasemonkey? Version 4.0 and above is currently not supported;
- [Open an issue](https://github.com/fp555/exh-tags-preview/issues/new) and convince me it's my fault.

### Hey I'd like you to add...
- [Open an issue](https://github.com/fp555/exh-tags-preview/issues/new) and convince me to do it. Even better, [create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).

### When I go on ExHentai I see an image of a sad panda?!?!
