# E(x)-Hentai Tags Preview :panda_face::label::mag:
This is an **unofficial** userscript, compatible with both panda websites, that shows a table with all tags assigned to a gallery that seamlessly blends with native page layouts. If you don't like the native *Extended* view, and others don't give you enough information, give this a try.

## Installation
If your browser does not natively support userscripts, install something like [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/) or [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/), then grab the [latest userscript release](https://github.com/fp555/exh-tags-preview/releases/latest/download/script.user.js).

This userscript has some configuration options, for your convenience you can change them from the :gear: icon that gets added next to the layout selector. [Check your release notes](https://github.com/fp555/exh-tags-preview/releases) for more details on available settings.

## Troubleshooting
Before [opening an issue](https://github.com/fp555/exh-tags-preview/issues/new) please:
1) Stop using weird and outdated browsers that don't support basic web standards or modern CSS/JS features;
2) Make sure your userscript manager is updated to the latest available version;
3) Make sure you are using the [latest release of the userscript](https://github.com/fp555/exh-tags-preview/releases/latest);
4) Make sure your issue isn't listed in the section below.

### Known issues & limitations
You could get an empty tooltip (or no tooltip at all) if:
- A gallery has no tags whatsoever. Please be a useful member of the community and add some yourself;
- A gallery is inaccessible (permanently deleted, copyright claimed, banned in your country...);
- E-H API is acting up (check your browser console).

### Missing features & requests
If it's something that's not too unrelated to the purpose of this userscript, [open an issue](https://github.com/fp555/exh-tags-preview/issues/new) and convince me to work on it. If you look closely you can see I already added tiny little fixes that are unrelated to displaying tags.

If you end up creating your own version of this userscript consider [creating a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) if you'd like me to merge your changes.

### Is this spyware?
I couldn't care less about your disgusting fetishes: I already have mine, and I can guarantee they're objectively better than yours :smirk:. Your questionable browsing history shall remain between you and your assigned glow-in-the-dark agent, 'cause I don't want anything to do with it. This userscript was originally made for personal use and convenience, and the idea of collecting user data has never crossed my mind. Luckily for you the source code is right here, you can just, like... read it or something.
