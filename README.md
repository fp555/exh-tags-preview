# E(x)hentai Tags Preview
This is an unofficial userscript for e-hentai/exhentai **(WARNING: NSFW websites)** that displays tags when you hover over a gallery link.

## Install
Install [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) *(Firefox only)*, [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/) or [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/), then **[click here to install the script](script.user.js)**

I only tested this with Chrome + Violentmonkey, but it **should** work with all browsers supported by your userscript manager (one of the above). Feedback welcome.
## Troubleshooting
#### It gives me an error / It doesn't work!
- Stop using weird browsers that don't respect/implement basic web standards;
- Make sure your browser and userscript manager are updated;
- [Open an issue](https://github.com/fp555/exh-tags-preview/issues/new) and convince me it's my fault.
#### Hey I'd like you to add `thing`, kthxbye

#### When I go on ExHentai I see an image of a sad panda?!?!
