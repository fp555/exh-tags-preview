# E(x)-Hentai Tags Preview :panda_face::label::mag:
This is an unofficial, simple userscript for e-hentai/exhentai that displays assigned tags when you hover over a gallery link. If you can't be bothered opening galleries every time to check if there's something absolutely disgusting and you don't want to use the native *Extended* layout, this is the script for you.

## Installation
If your browser does not natively support userscripts, install something like [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/) or [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/), then grab the [latest userscript release](https://github.com/fp555/exh-tags-preview/releases/latest/download/script.user.js).

The script will autoconfigure the default settings on first run. Starting with v1.8.0 there is an options button at the bottom right corner of the webpage. [Check your release notes](https://github.com/fp555/exh-tags-preview/releases) for more details on available settings.

## Troubleshooting
Before [opening an issue](https://github.com/fp555/exh-tags-preview/issues/new) please:
1) Stop using weird and outdated browsers that don't support basic web standards or modern CSS/JS features;
2) Make sure your userscript manager is updated to the latest available version;
3) Make sure you are using the [latest release of the userscript](https://github.com/fp555/exh-tags-preview/releases/latest);
4) Make sure your issue isn't listed in the section below.

### Known issues & limitations
You will get an empty tooltip (or no tooltip at all) if:
- A gallery has no tags whatsoever. Please be a useful member of the community and add some yourself;
- A gallery triggers the "offensive content" warning and you have it enabled. Make sure you *clearly* understand the consequences of disabling it;
- A gallery is inaccessible (permanently deleted, copyright claimed, banned in your country...).

### Missing features & requests
If it's something that's not too unrelated to the purpose of this userscript, [open an issue](https://github.com/fp555/exh-tags-preview/issues/new) and convince me to work on it.

If you end up creating your own version of this userscript consider [creating a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) if you'd like me to merge your changes.

### Is this spyware? (Privacy policy)
I couldn't care less about your disgusting fetishes: I already have mine, and I can guarantee they're objectively better than yours :smirk:. Your questionable browsing history shall remain between you and your assigned glow-in-the-dark agent from your domestic mass surveillance agencies. This userscript was originally made for personal use and convenience, and the idea of collecting user data has never crossed my mind.
